# DBMS_JAVA_PROJECT
This is a simple DBMS project created using java.
In this project the user can perform the following operations
- Create a new excel sheet with columns to represent categories
- Insert rows 
- Read a specific row by entering a key value
- Read All the rows present in the sheet
- Delete a row 
The java program monitors and track files in a particular folder and interprets the commands. The program processes these commands performs the operations, updates the excel file(our database)
and appends the status/result back to the same file.

Made use of the Apache POI API to connect with EXCEL.
